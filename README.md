# Capstone-Project-Game
I'm a beginner, a baby, does not have any experience with making a game.

context:
This is our capstone project for our IT Capstone, we decided on making a game for our capstone.
As of currently im the only one developing our game cuz my members also don't know how to make a game.
I also dont know how to make a game, but I'm making it as I learn how to make it.

Our Game is an educational game, if you want to know more read the document of our project.

If you see this and you have spare time, please do care take a look on our project and give me some advise to improve on.
advise for beginners as much as possible T_T

that's all thank you.
